# VanguardTIOWAddon
This is a config addon for the There Is Only War mod being made for the 34th Vanguard.
What this addon does:
- Fixes a spelling mistake("[Cadian] Innfantry Backpack" is now "[Cadian] Infantry Backpack").
- Adds a Cadian Infantry AT Backpack which has double the space of the normal Cadian Infantry Backpack.
- Adds a High-Powered powerpack for the M36 Kantrael with double the damage but half the ammo capacity.
- Adds 100rnd and 150rnd versions of the heavy stubber mags.
- Increases the space of the Cadian Medicae Backpack and Cadian Medicae Backpack (Winter Camo) by 50%.
- Adds Vanguard Flak Armor that has a ~30% armor value increase over the normal Cadian Flak Armor. Now has a simple retexture.
- Adds Vanguard Medicae Flak Armor that has a ~30% armor value increase over the normal Cadian Medicae Flak Armor. Now has a simple retexture.
- Adds two Vanguard helmets. The normal helmet and the Hostile Eviroment version with a facemask. Both have a 125% armor value increase - over the normal Cadian Helmets.
- Adds a [Vanguard] Unkown Pattern Las-LMG which is currently using the m36 model. Will get a model once it's finnished.
- Adds a 150rnd and 200rnd Las-LMG powerpack for the Las-LMG.
- Modifies the Type 14 and Hellgun powerpacks to be carriable. You can carry two with the Infantry AT Backpack.
- Increases the damage by Krak Missiles by around 50%.
- Adds a Smoke Missile for the DKoK Launcher.
- Adds a Melta Missile for the DKoK Launcher.
- Space Marines are now killable.
- Fixes the latest invincibility issues caused by uniforms with increased armor values in the latest ace update.
- Adds/Modifies vest items for units to compensate for their loss of uniform armor.
- Adds a Vanguard Grenade launcher in the Sidearm slot. Litterally the same as the Cadian one except the animation is wierd.
- Increased the armor value for the Patrol and Officer Caps to be the same as the Vanguard Helmet.
- Error message from when you opened your inventory while a invisible armor was equiped has now been fixed.
- Adds a Vanguard Lucius Pattern Grenade launcher in the Sidearm slot. Litterally the same as the Krieg one except the animation is wierd.
- Adds a Vanguard Meltagun in the Sidearm slot. Litterally the same as the Imperium one except the animation is wierd.
- Buffs the 60mm grenades for the (Both Vanguard and Imperium)Lucius Pattern Grenade launcher and adds ace shrapnel to it.
- AT ammo for the Tau ion rifle was added.
- LR Backpack for the Tau was added.
- Probably something else I forgot about.



*IMPORTANT* If you are playing a unit that used to have extra armor in the uniform, you have to equip it's dedicated vest item. For the priest that would be the Priest Belt but for the commissar and other units who didn't have a vest item I have now added it("[Krieg] Uniform Armor" or "[Imperium] Commissar Armor" for example). It will give you the armor you lost in the fix.
